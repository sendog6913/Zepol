        As for myself, I enjoy being with my family (including our cat Moshi). Being around nature and hearing the sounds of silence is very relaxing. When on the nature zone, bird watching can be very interesting and entertaining.

        I am a technical person at heart. As a problem solver since being a small kid, I had learned how to build lowrider bicycles, and modify/adjust a car sound system. It was only a matter of time until we had a computer and started wondering how it worked.
      </p>

        Before going to college I started to become familiar with the computer parts. In the first year of college, I built my first one successfully! It was amazing! I then had the opportunity to build other computers for family members based on different budget constraints. On my last year of High School, I had a computer class and they showed us how to build a simple website using MS Notepad. This class is what started my passion for web development.

        During my college years, I was also a computer technician. This is when I learned that these amazing computers can also be a pain to troubleshoot, and in some cases, the fix did not make sense, but it worked! and that's what mattered.
      </p>

        Also, my major was in Computer Information Systems, and this is where my web development skills began to really develop. With the help with my computer tech buddies, I had access to software (Adobe Dreamweaver) that made web development a bit easier than using MS Notepad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I am capable of working with different kinds of useful web technologies like WordPress, SharePoint, MS Power Platform. <strong>What's Next?</strong>
